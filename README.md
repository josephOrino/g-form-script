# Google Form Automation Script

## Description
A Python script that uses Selenium to automate filling out a specific Google Form. It can input text into short answer and long answer fields, and select options from dropdowns. Useful as a reference for automating other Google Forms. Requires Selenium and ChromeDriver.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- ChromeDriver (download from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and add to your PATH)

## Setup
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure ChromeDriver is accessible from your system PATH or update the script accordingly.
3. Customize the script with your specific Google Form URL and input values.

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python google_form_auto.py
```

The script will:
- Open Chrome
- Navigate to the specified Google Form
- Fill in short answers, long answers, and dropdowns
- Optionally submit the form

## Notes
- This script is designed for a specific form but can be adapted for others.
- CAPTCHA-protected forms may interrupt automation.
- Adjust field targeting as needed if your form structure changes.
